    Manufacturing and alignment of spectrometers requires line scan
    visualization of camera output. Many vendors provide bare-bones or 
    non existent line graphs. LineGrab uses a variety of communication
    techniques to provide full-screen line graph visualizations. These
    are critical for the precise alignment of spectrometers.
