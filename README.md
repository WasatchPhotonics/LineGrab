    Manufacturing and alignment of spectrometers requires line scan
    visualization of camera output. Many vendors provide bare-bones or 
    non existent line graphs. LineGrab uses a variety of communication
    techniques to provide full-screen line graph visualizations. These
    are critical for the precise alignment of spectrometers.


Currently supported cameras include:
```
Wasatch Photonics Cobra series
```

In development cameras, all through DALSA framegrabbers:
```
DALSA Spyder
Sprint Basler
Sensors Unlimited GL2048
```
